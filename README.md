# cohort-4-assignments

This repository contains assignments completed as part of Cohort 4.

Every line of code in this repository is written manually by me without the use of any AI tools, code generators, or automated assistance. All logic, structure, and implementation decisions are the result of my own understanding, problem-solving, and experimentation.

The purpose of this repository is to document genuine learning, hands-on practice, and real progress through writing code from scratch. Any mistakes, iterations, or improvements reflect an authentic development process.

This repository stands as a transparent record of effort, learning, and ownership over the codebase.
